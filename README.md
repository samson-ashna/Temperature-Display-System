# temperature-display-system-project
This repository contains the project that uses an Arduino board and a DE10 board to build a Temperature Display System.

### Project Scope
An Arduino board and a DE10 board will be used to build a Temperature Display System as part of the project's scope. Accurate temperature sensing is a goal of the project, as are measurements displayed on an attached OLED screen and transmission of a 5-bit binary temperature representation from the Arduino to the DE10 board. The temperature value will be displayed on the segment display of the DE10 board after the binary data is interpreted. The range of work includes setting up bi-directional connections, accurately converting data, and conducting extensive testing.
